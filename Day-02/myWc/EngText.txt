I wake up in the morning gazing at the gloomy city lost amidst the grey clouds Every day it seems to become more lonely and
deserted People pass by immersed in their own thoughts and troubles oblivious to the world surrounding them The gazes of

secrets harbor the stories of people who once lived here but have long been gone
